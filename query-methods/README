This is an example application of my following blog entries:

- Spring Data Solr Tutorial: Configuration - http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/solr/spring-data-solr-tutorial-configuration/

NOTE: Only the functions described in the blog entries mentioned above are working at the moment.

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

- Download and install Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation). If you have already installed Maven 3, you can skip this step.
- If you don't already have a local Solr installation, you have create one. You might want to read this
  blog entry: http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/maven/running-solr-with-maven/
- Configure the value of the solr.solr.home property found from the profile specific properties files (application.properties).
- Go the root directory of project (The one which contains the pom.xml file)
- Run command mvn clean jetty:run
- Start your browser and go to the location: http://localhost:8080
- Use credentials (user/password) to log in.

RUNNING TESTS:

- You can run unit tests by using this command: mvn test -P dev
- The integration tests are not working at the moment but they would work, you could run them by
  using a command: mvn verify -P integration-test
